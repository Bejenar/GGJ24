text ch1 "Well, ain't this a sight for sore eyes!"
text ch1 "Back in my day, we didn't have places like this. But I reckon it's a sign of the times, eh?"
text mc "Absolutely, sir. Times sure have changed."
text mc "So, what's the occasion bringing you here tonight?"
text ch1 "Oh, no special occasion, sonny. Just felt like taking a stroll down memory lane, see if I can't catch a chuckle or two."
text mc "Ah, I see. Well, you've come to the right place for a laugh. Our memes cover all sorts of humor."
text mc "Anything in particular catching your eye?"
text ch1 "Well now, I always did fancy a good joke, you know? The kind that gets you grinning from ear to ear without even trying."
text mc "Tell you what, sir, there's a meme I stumbled upon earlier that might just tickle your fancy. It's got a certain... flair for wordplay, if you catch my drift."
text ch1 "Wordplay, you say? Now that's right up my alley! Always did love a clever turn of phrase."
text mc "Well then, I think you'll appreciate this one."

text ch2 "Heh, you're pretty nice for a bartender."
text mc "You know what helps me best when I feel down? Binge-watching some anime. 'Frieren,' that's airing this winter, is really good."
text ch2 "Oh, you like anime too?"
text mc "Absolutely. Anime has this magical way of transporting you to different worlds, you know?"
text mc "And 'Frieren' is just... it's like a journey through emotions. Really hits you in the feels.?"
text ch2 "Yeah, I get that. Anime has been my escape for a while now. Helps me forget about everything else for a bit."
